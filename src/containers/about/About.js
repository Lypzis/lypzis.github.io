                                An expert in front-end development helping in the creation of beautiful,
                                responsive and functional applications. I enjoy shaping simple and
                                effective designs along with a clean, descriptive and well commented code.
                            <br></br>
                                I have very diverse and libertarian ideals. I have a big appreciation for technology and innovation and I'm a
                                big fan of open source software. I also
                                love to make experiments and
                                learning from them. At my free time, I mostly enjoy playing games, laughing at memes and watching series.
